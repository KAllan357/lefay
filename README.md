# LeFay

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. She's pretty cool. This version runs on Riot Games' internal Jabber server.

# Playing with LeFay

LeFay runs under ~lefay on the DAT (Deployment Automation Tools) team's defunct git server. She runs in a loop that continuously checks for updates from this Git repository.

All you need to do is commit changes and then say "lefay: please, when you have a moment, reboot yourself" in open chat.

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples. Add whatever functionality you want LeFay to have.

# hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts). To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with extension as a double quoted string to the hubot-scripts.json file in this repo.
